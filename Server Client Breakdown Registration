Server end:

Set<String> chatNames = string names of all the client name
    - is the above the same as the key value stored in the writers map?
    

executor service creates a fixed thread pool of 500
    infinite while loop:
        executes a thread from the pool
            pass in: new handler
                pass in:  the Socket read in from serverSocket
                

Handler:

this controls all of the message handling for each of the writers

    socket is set and stored, input and output streams created

    message handling :
        this is done through reference to the message type:
            the types are stored as strings i.e. "REGISTRATION"
                execute relevant code when server made aware of the new writer
                
                
at the moment... registration code is peformed within the handler
this could be abstracted
